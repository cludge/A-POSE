    <h2>History of QCU</h2>

    <div class="history-container">
        <p id="p1">Quezon City University, also identified as Quezon City Polytechnic University, was established on March 1, 1995, through City Council Ordinance No. SP-0171, also known as Serial Port 0171. QCPU was first founded with the specific purpose of training and developing skilled and technical workers.</p>
        <p id="p2">QCU has undergone significant progress in the three decades since it was founded. QCU now provides degree programs in accounting and entrepreneurship, information technology, and engineering as opposed to just being a technical education provider. In the near future, QCU will offer suitable undergraduate and graduate programs to meet the demands of both local and international markets, attracting more skilled and deserving students.</p>
